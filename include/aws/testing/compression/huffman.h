 * The intended use of file is to allow testing of huffman character coders.
 * By doing the following, you can ensure the output of encoders decoders are correct:
 * \code{c}
 * static struct huffman_test_code_point code_points[] = {
 * #include "test_huffman_static_table.def"
 * };
 * \endcode
 * You may then iterate over each code point in the array, and test the following (pseudo-code):
 * \code{c}
 * for (cp in code_points) {
 *     assert(my_coder->encode(cp.symbol) == cp.pattern);
 *     assert(my_coder->decode(cp.pattern) == cp.symbol);
